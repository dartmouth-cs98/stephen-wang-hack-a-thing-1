# Todo List

## What you built? 
A simplistic todo list built using React, Redux, and Framer Motion.
Supports the following functionality:
- Mark tasks as done or uncheck them
- Records timestamp of each task creation
- Menu for each task that allows renaming and changing task status
- Deleting tasks
- Filtering of only incomplete or complete tasks

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?
I worked alone so I did the whole thing.

## What you learned
My goal was to get more comfortable with React as I had never worked with it before and it's a fundamental part of web development. Having had some background in Javascript, I found implementing most of the logic behind the todo list to be manageable. What I found more challenging to understand was how to write Redux and how it connects to local storage and the general infrastructure of the app.
